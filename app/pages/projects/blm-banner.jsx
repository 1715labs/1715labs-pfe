          Today, June 10, we show our support for the intersectional coalition
          participating in #ShutdownSTEM. We invite everyone to join us in reflecting
          how we can fight systematic racism in STEM (Science Technology Engineering
          and Mathematics) and beyond, and build a more welcoming, just and
          equitable community.
